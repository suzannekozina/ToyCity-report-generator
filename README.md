# ToyCity Report Generator, Part 2 - Udacity Nanodegree Project

## Project Overview

Analyze data and generate a sales report. Package the code so that pieces of it can be reused in future sales reports. Output your reports to a file, instead of command line.


## Completing this Project

This program does the following:
* Loops over data in a JSON file
* Analyzes "Number of Products in Stock," "Average Product Price," and "Total Sales"
* Outputs the properly formatted report to a `report.txt` file.
* Uses methods to reduce code duplication and increase readability.
