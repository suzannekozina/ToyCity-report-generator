# ToyCity Report Generator, Part 2 - Udacity Nanodegree Project

## Project Overview

Analyze data and generate a sales report. You will package the code so that pieces of it can be reused in future sales reports. Output your reports to a file, instead of command line.


## Completing this Project

Unsure your program does the following:

* Outputs all the same data as required in ToyCity Part 1.
* Outputs the properly formatted report to a `report.txt` file.
* Uses methods to reduce code duplication and increase readability.
